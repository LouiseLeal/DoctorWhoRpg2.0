<fala>Planet Earth. This is where I was born, and this is where I died. The first 19 years of my life, nothing happened. Nothing at all. Not ever. And then I met a man called the Doctor. A man who can change his face. He took me away from home in his magical machine. He showed me the whole of time and space. I thought it would never end. That's what I thought. But then came the army of ghosts, and came torchwood and the war. That's when it all ended. This is the story of how I died.</fala>
